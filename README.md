# CINF 405 Project of Group 5 
- Jian Zhong
- This repo contains my individual logs for the project.

- I made the Game map: ![2](https://github.com/a2677331/CINF-405-Project/blob/main/map.png)
- I coded a simple game demo from sketch: [Project Files](https://github.com/a2677331/CINF-405-Project/tree/main/investment_valley)
- I divided the project into a list of features to be done: ![3](https://github.com/a2677331/CINF-405-Project/blob/main/to_be_done.png)
- I added building name for each building using Photoshop: ![4](https://github.com/a2677331/CINF-405-Project/blob/main/ground.png)
- I wrote an intro screen for the game: ![5](https://github.com/a2677331/CINF-405-Project/blob/main/intro_screen.png)
- I added a timer of 300 seconds for each round of the game: ![6](https://github.com/a2677331/CINF-405-Project/blob/main/timer.png)
- What I did:
  - [x] added a money score in the top bar
  - [x] set a timer for 5 min
  - [x] label each building with names "stock exchange", "casino"...
  - [x] player can move using arrow keys
  - [x] 5 buildings with collision detection, so player cannot move across each building
  - [x] player animations
  - [x] game map and builidng images
  - [x] Intro screen: Initial running the game will display an intro screen without a money score, while subsequent runs will show both the introduction screen with the money score from previously played: ![6](https://github.com/a2677331/CINF-405-Project/blob/main/intro_screen.png) ![7](https://github.com/a2677331/CINF-405-Project/blob/main/intro_screen.png)
  - fixed bugs: time limit would start counting even if game is not active yet
- Other team members' responsibilities:
  - player can "talk" to building, and shows a dialog window (Dylan)
  - make graphs showing the price trend for stock, crypto, and real estate trading (Dominick)
  - player can buy/sell stocks, crypto or houses (Nick)
  - functions for casino, lottery, bank (Aidan)
